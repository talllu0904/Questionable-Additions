# Questionable Additions
A Minecraft 1.20.1 mod for testing and learning purposes.

## Project Overview
This mod is a testing ground for my first attempts at modding Minecraft.
I'm using it to learn the basics of mod development and experiment with new ideas.

## Current Features
* Ruby block set [ore, raw and refined ruby, block]
* Compressed coal block (does work as furnace fuel)

## Planned Features
* More compressed blocks [stone, cobblestone, diamond, netherack, etc.]
* Item sets using Ruby [tools, weapons,armor, etc.]
* Other item sets using different materials [steel, metal alloys, etc.]
* Upgraded furnaces
* Processing blocks [crusher, allot smelter, etc.]
  - Along with appropriate tools [hammer, mining hammer, etc.]
* Item pipes/fluid pipes

## Installation
1. Download the mod jar from the releases page.
2. Install the required dependencies (e.g., Minecraft Forge, etc.).
3. Place the mod jar in your Minecraft mods folder.

## Usage
* To craft the Ruby block set, simply combine the required materials in a crafting table.
* To use the compressed coal block as furnace fuel, simply place it in a furnace and light it.

## Contributing
If you'd like to contribute to this mod, please report any issues or submit pull requests. I'm open to feedback and suggestions!

## Credits
* This mod takes inspiration from several other mods, including Allthecompressed, Mekanism, Iron Furnaces, and the pipez mod. While I'm not using any of their code, I want to acknowledge their influence on my work.

## Known Issues
* None at the moment

## Changelog

  - Added ruby with ore and block
  - Compressed coal block

## License
